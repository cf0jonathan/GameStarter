Game Design Document
Premise
The game is relatively simple. In this infinite side scroller, you play as a rocket, which follows your mouse, and navigate through an asteroid field, avoiding hitting any asteroids. That's about it, pretty simple concept, but possible hours of fun.

Level design
There won't necessarily be levels, but rather the random generation of the asteroids will get more frequent. This will make it more difficult to navigate through the field.

Mechanics
The rocket will have momentum, so it won't instantly react to mouse movements. The speed of the rocket will have a slow ramp-up, and it will depend on how far the mouse is from the rocket, creating a trade-off. Having the mouse close to the rocket will allow for finer control, but having it far away allows for greater speed.

Media integration
There will be a graphic for the rocket, and multiple graphics for the asteroids. There will be a repeating background of stars. Some very “space” sounding royalty-free music will play if I can find any. There will also be an explosion sound when an asteroid is hit, as well as an explosion graphic.


Project structure should be component based. assets and objects should be in xml, such as texture names.
