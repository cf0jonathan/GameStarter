Assignment: Integrate Box2D Physics into SDL Game Engine
Objective:

Integrate Box2D into an SDL-based game engine to simulate realistic physics interactions. The assignment will cover the use of Box2D's features like dynamic body manipulation, raycasting, AABB querying, and contact handling in a demo environment with static and dynamic objects.

Requirements:

Box2D Integration:
Integrate Box2D with the SDL game engine so that physics bodies can be created, manipulated, and rendered in the game world.
Use b2Body's userData field to store a pointer to the associated GameObject in SDL, allowing the retrieval of objects during physics events (e.g., contacts, queries, and raytracing).
Dynamic Forces and Velocities:
Implement functionality to apply force, set linear velocity, and/or angular velocity to Box2D bodies.

Demonstrate these functionalities in a way that is interactive or easily testable within the demo (e.g., via keypresses or timed events).

Physics Queries: Implement at least one of the following in the demo:
Raycasting: Show raycasting in action, tracing rays through the scene and detecting intersections with Box2D bodies.
AABB Querying: Implement AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) querying to detect bodies within a specified area.
Contact Listening: Use Box2D’s contact listener to detect and respond to collisions between bodies.

Adding and Removing Bodies:
Allow for the addition and removal of Box2D bodies at runtime. This can be done interactively (e.g., pressing keys to spawn or delete objects) or programmatically in the demo.

Ensure that the demo can handle both static and dynamic bodies:
Static Bodies: Objects that do not move but can interact with dynamic bodies (e.g., walls or ground).
Dynamic Bodies: Objects affected by forces, velocities, and collisions.

Demo Application:
Create a demo showcasing the integrated Box2D functionality within the SDL game engine.
The demo should include both static and dynamic objects, with clear examples of body interactions, query responses, and real-time object manipulation.
